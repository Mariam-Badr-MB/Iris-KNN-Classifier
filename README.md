# Iris KNN Classifier 🌸

This project is a simple and effective implementation of a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier on the famous **Iris dataset**.  
It aims to predict the species of iris flowers based on features like petal and sepal dimensions.

## 📂 Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Iris dataset (built-in from sklearn).
- **Model**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- **Goal**: Classify iris flowers into three species: *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica*.

## 🚀 Features

- Load and explore the Iris dataset.
- Data preprocessing and preparation.
- Build and train a KNN model.
- Evaluate the model's performance.
- Visualize the results.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📒
- Libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn


## 📊 Results

The KNN model achieves high accuracy in classifying the Iris species.  
Visualizations also help to understand the model's decision boundaries.
